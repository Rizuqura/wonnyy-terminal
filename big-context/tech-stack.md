# Technology Stack — Wonnyy V0.0.1-Amadeus

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the technology stack for Wonnyy V0.0.1-Amadeus.

It describes:

- What each technology is.
- Why Amadeus uses it.
- Which architectural layer it belongs to.
- What function it performs.
- What the founder needs to understand.
- What the MVP should prove through testing.
- Which technologies are selected, proposed, or intentionally excluded.

This document is a technical reference for both the founder and AI coding agents.

# 2. Technology Philosophy

## 2.1 Requirement Before Technology

Technology must follow product and architecture requirements.

Do not introduce a technology simply because it is:

- Popular.
- Modern.
- Powerful.
- Common in other projects.
- Recommended by an AI model.

A technology should have a clear responsibility within Amadeus.

---

## 2.2 Simple Before Advanced

Prefer:

- Simple architecture.
- Small dependencies.
- Understandable code.
- Local-first infrastructure.
- Explicit interfaces.
- Minimal external services.

Avoid premature:

- Databases.
- Distributed systems.
- Vector databases.
- Multi-agent systems.
- Cloud infrastructure.
- Microservices.

---

## 2.3 Requirement ≠ Implementation

A product requirement does not automatically determine a specific technology.

For example:

```text
Requirement:
Amadeus needs local filesystem access.

Possible implementations:
- Electron
- Tauri
- Other local runtime
````

Therefore:

> Requirements should be stable; implementation choices may change.

---

## 2.4 AI-Assisted Development

AI will generate and modify a significant portion of the application.

However, the technology stack must remain understandable to the founder.

AI-generated implementation must not introduce a dependency without explaining:

1. What the dependency does.
2. Why it is required.
3. Which layer it belongs to.
4. What problem it solves.
5. Whether it can be replaced.
6. Whether it introduces additional architectural complexity.

# 4. Architecture Relationship

The technology stack implements the following architecture:

```text
                         USER
                           │
                           ▼
                    ┌────────────┐
                    │     UI     │
                    └─────┬──────┘
                          │
             ┌────────────┴────────────┐
             │                         │
             ▼                         ▼
      KNOWLEDGE INTERFACE       MODEL INTERFACE
             │                         │
             ▼                         ▼
       LOCAL KNOWLEDGE            MODEL GATEWAY
             │                         │
       ┌─────┴─────┐            ┌─────┴─────┐
       ▼           ▼            ▼           ▼
    Markdown      CSV         GPT        Claude
                                  │
                                  ▼
                               Gemini
```

When a task requires both Knowledge and AI:

```text
Knowledge Interface
↓
Search / Retrieval
↓
Context Engine
↓
Model Interface
↓
Model Provider
↓
Response
```

The fundamental architectural relationship is:

```text
KNOWLEDGE ≠ MODEL

CONTEXT = BRIDGE
```

Knowledge and Model capabilities should remain independently replaceable.

# 27. Technology Boundaries

The following boundaries must remain explicit.

## UI → Application Logic

The UI requests capabilities.

The UI should not directly implement domain logic.

---

## Application → Filesystem

Filesystem access belongs to the local runtime / Knowledge layer.

UI components should not directly read arbitrary files.

---

## Knowledge → Context

Knowledge provides information.

The Context Engine determines which information is relevant to the current model task.

---

## Context → Model

The Context Engine prepares model input.

The Model Interface sends it to the selected provider.

---

## Model → UI

The model response returns through the application layer before being rendered.

The UI should not contain provider-specific API logic.

---

# 40. Engineering North Star

The engineering objective is not to maximize technical sophistication.

The objective is:

> **Build the smallest technology stack capable of proving Wonnyy's core thesis.**

The system should demonstrate:

```text
User-Owned Information
        ↓
Persistent Information Bank
        ↓
Relevant Context
        ↓
Replaceable AI Models
        ↓
Useful Intelligence
```

The technology stack should preserve two fundamental boundaries:

```text
KNOWLEDGE ≠ MODEL

CONTEXT = BRIDGE
```

The model is the reasoning engine.

The knowledge environment is the persistent infrastructure.

The Context Engine determines how the two interact.

---

# 41. Final Technology Principle

> **Do not add technology because we might need it. Add technology when a validated requirement proves that we need it.**

Amadeus V0.0.1 should remain:

```text
Simple
Local
Understandable
Model-Agnostic
Context-Aware
AI-Assisted
Testable
Extensible
```

The purpose of the MVP is not to demonstrate how many technologies can be used.

The purpose is to demonstrate:

```text
Knowledge
+
Context
+
Replaceable Models
=
Persistent AI-Assisted Intelligence
```

```

This one is now specifically structured as **`tech-stack.md`**, rather than mixing the technology reference with the broader engineering curriculum.
```

# Engineering Context — Wonnyy V0.0.1-Amadeus

## 1. Engineering Objective

Wonnyy V0.0.1-Amadeus is an internal AI-native knowledge and data workspace.

The engineering objective is not to build a large-scale production system immediately.

The objective is to build a small, understandable, extensible MVP that allows the founder to:

- Understand the architecture.
- Read AI-generated code.
- Debug AI-generated code.
- Maintain the project.
- Understand APIs and data flow.
- Understand local filesystem interaction.
- Understand how AI models connect to application context.
- Build the MVP through AI-assisted development.

The founder should become technically capable enough to lead and maintain the system without needing to become a professional software engineer.

This follows the original curriculum principle:

> Learn enough engineering to build products. Do not become an engineer unless your mission requires it.

# 2. Engineering Philosophy

## 2.1 Product-Driven Engineering

Technology choices must follow product requirements.

Do not introduce a technology simply because it is popular, modern, or potentially useful.

---

## 2.2 Simple Before Advanced

Prefer:

- Simple architecture
- Small dependencies
- Understandable code
- Local-first implementation
- Explicit interfaces
- Minimal infrastructure

Avoid premature:

- Databases
- Distributed systems
- Vector databases
- Agents
- Cloud infrastructure
- Microservices

---

## 2.3 AI-Assisted but Human-Understandable

AI may generate a significant portion of the implementation.

However, generated code must remain understandable to the founder.

The founder should be able to answer:

- What does this component do?
- Where does this data come from?
- Where does this function send the data?
- What happens when it fails?
- Why does this dependency exist?
- What architectural layer does this belong to?

---

## 2.4 Model Independence

The application must not become fundamentally dependent on a single AI provider.

The model interface should remain replaceable.

Conceptually:

Wonnyy
↓
Model Interface
↓
Model Gateway
↓
GPT / Claude / Gemini / Qwen / DeepSeek

---

## 2.5 Knowledge Independence

Knowledge operations should not require an AI model.

The system should be able to:

- Discover files
- Read files
- Display files
- Search files

without calling an AI model.

---

# 3. Engineering Architecture

The V0.0.1 engineering architecture is:

                         USER
                           │
                           ▼
                    ┌────────────┐
                    │     UI     │
                    └─────┬──────┘
                          │
             ┌────────────┴────────────┐
             │                         │
             ▼                         ▼
      KNOWLEDGE INTERFACE       MODEL INTERFACE
             │                         │
             ▼                         ▼
       LOCAL KNOWLEDGE            MODEL GATEWAY
             │                         │
       ┌─────┴─────┐            ┌─────┴─────┐
       ▼           ▼            ▼           ▼
    Markdown      CSV         GPT        Claude
                                  │
                                  ▼
                               Gemini

When Knowledge and AI are both required:

Knowledge Interface

Search / Retrieval

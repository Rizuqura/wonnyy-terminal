# Wonnyy implementation tasks

## Current execution order

Updated 2026-09-10. Authority: [Context Windows & Human-Controlled Context Engineering](./context-engineering-experience.md). Current implementation evidence: [state.md](./state.md) and [September 10 audit](./project-audit-2026-09-10.md).

**Roadmap: M8 → M9 → M9.5 → M10 → M11. Immediate work: M9-A context controls, independently of unresolved M8 acceptance.** M9-B model consumption follows acceptance of the controls. The tasks below are planned work, not delivered runtime behavior.

### M8 - Chat reliability: acceptance pending

- [ ] Review ten natural turns on each of two sources using the chosen real model, including relevance, grounding, instruction following and latency.
- [ ] Verify return to the original conversation, restart, provider/model switching, more than 12 exchanges, source updates, cancellation and recovery.
- [ ] Resolve reproduced failures and record acceptance against agreed quality/latency expectations. Mock success and starred sample checks do not close this gate.

### M9-A - Context control experience: immediate target

Implemented selection foundation: shared Explorer/Planet multi-selection, Planet rectangle selection with additive modifiers and cancellation, selected counts, pan alternatives, and a control guide above Asteroid Visible. Existing Station assignment can apply to the selected group. This is partial progress toward the bulk-arrangement task below; named Context Windows and their controls are still absent.

The user has prioritized working, comfortable controls before model consumption. M8 acceptance remains open and does not block this independent phase. Follow [the M9-A execution specification](./context-engineering-experience.md#5-immediate-execution-scope---controls-before-model-consumption).

- [ ] Define and persist vault-scoped named Context Windows, including reviewed source membership, group origins, pins, budget, version and change-detection metadata.
- [ ] Add create, rename, switch and reopen controls in a visible context panel, with explicit save/error feedback.
- [ ] Add multi-selection and bulk arrangement: shared Explorer/Planet selection, source-list checkboxes/ranges, selected counts, and Add to existing/new Context Window with one review. Preserve selection when review is cancelled.
- [ ] Add bulk authorize, pin/unpin and remove/undo. Deduplicate overlapping groups, disclose hidden selections, and keep filtered Select all scoped to visible results. Verify keyboard/focus behavior and mixed-authorization states.
- [ ] Connect Planet/Explorer selection and Station/directory candidates to review and authorization controls. Deduplicate shared sources and review new group members before authorizing them.
- [ ] Add pin/unpin, removal and clear flows with understandable grouping and reversible edits. Keep Selected, Authorized, Pinned and Used distinct.
- [ ] Add editable budget and approximate source-cost feedback; show unknown/over-budget states without blocking edits or implying an executable model package.
- [ ] Verify keyboard/focus behavior, restart persistence, vault isolation, changed/missing sources and failed-write recovery through the actual interface.
- [ ] Review comfort with the user: build and refine two reusable windows without a configured model, unnecessary repeated setup or interface lockups.

M9-A must not submit model requests, alter current chat authorization or claim sources were Used. Existing supported formats can be organized as objects without claiming they are model-readable. Supporting reading/search improvements should be prioritized where they directly remove friction in this workflow.

### M9-B - Model consumption and provenance: deferred until controls are accepted

Scope update: the user requested Station-approved context consumption now. A bounded multi-source path is implemented through existing Active Context (1-32 Markdown/CSV/PDF-text sources), with full-set identity, controlled reads, provenance and resumption. See [the handoff](./station-model-context-handoff.md). The unchecked items below still apply to named Context Windows and pin/budget policies; this does not complete M9-B as originally specified.

User verification: two Markdown sources worked after manual context sizing. Exact successful saved settings and maximum usable capacity remain unverified.

- [ ] Unify sidebar/runtime token estimation and expose a pre-send budget breakdown with required versus available space.
- [ ] Record a controlled capacity benchmark per provider/model, including saved context/output settings, source count, estimated prompt size, latency and outcome. Do not treat configured limits as measured capacity.

- [ ] Define conversation/window binding and compatibility with existing Active Context and saved chats.
- [ ] Build multi-source packages with runtime authorization, source hashes, window versions and model/history/output budgets.
- [ ] Enforce pin and budget policies at execution; record actual Used sources separately from authorized candidates.
- [ ] Verify source/window edits, continuation, provider switching and isolation through the complete research conversation.

### Later milestones

- **M9.5 - Semantic retrieval:** add retrieval/ranking within the inspectable authorized boundary after M9 acceptance.
- **M10 - CSV / analytics tools:** add analysis capabilities after context construction and retrieval foundations.
- **M11 - Tool-using agent:** add controlled tool use after the preceding milestones. This does not automatically authorize autonomous actions or model-written vault changes.

Provider expansion is not the next primary milestone. Keep the existing Ollama/Gemini/NVIDIA integration as the execution foundation and fix provider defects that block acceptance.

# 18. MVP Acceptance Test

Amadeus V0.0.1 is considered functional when the following scenario works:

### Scenario

The user selects:

```text
/research/
```

containing:

```text
/research/
├── TSMC.md
├── Semiconductor.md
├── Macro.md
└── financials.csv
```

The user asks:

> Why did TSMC margins improve?

### Expected System Behavior

```text
1. Folder is accessible.
2. Files are discovered.
3. Search identifies relevant TSMC sources.
4. Context Engine selects relevant information.
5. Context is passed to Model Interface.
6. OpenRouter sends the request to the selected model.
7. Model returns an answer.
8. UI displays the answer.
9. Relevant sources remain identifiable.
```

### Acceptance

* [ ] Complete flow works.
* [ ] No application crash.
* [ ] No API key exposure.
* [ ] Irrelevant files are not blindly included.
* [ ] Model provider can be changed.
* [ ] Knowledge layer works independently from the AI layer.

```

These are future possibilities, not V0.0.1 requirements.

---

# 21. Definition of Done

A task is not considered complete merely because AI generated code for it.

A task is complete when:

* [ ] Implementation exists.
* [ ] Implementation belongs to the correct architectural layer.
* [ ] Expected behavior is tested.
* [ ] Error behavior is considered.
* [ ] Generated code has been reviewed.
* [ ] No unnecessary dependency was introduced.
* [ ] Documentation/context is updated if architecture changed.
* [ ] Git commit is created.

---

# 22. Final MVP Goal

The entire V0.0.1 task list exists to prove one core loop:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│     USER-OWNED KNOWLEDGE    │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               ↓
        Search / Retrieval
               ↓
        Context Engine
               ↓
        Model Interface
               ↓
       Replaceable AI Model
               ↓
        Useful Intelligence
```

The MVP should prove that this loop works reliably before additional infrastructure is introduced.
